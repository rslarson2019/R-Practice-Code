# Overview

I created these programs to practice the R language. I made multiple functions. 
One that will create 3 random linear functions and graph them, another that will graph random points on a plot, and
one last one that reads datasets from a csv file and plots the points on a graph

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and a local R environment on my laptop to run this code. I am publishing
this onto a public Github repository.

# Future Work

- I want to create a longer list of datasets to use
- I want to add additional functions to the repo
- I want to create tutorials for people to learn off these functions
